title: Call for Participation&#58; Engaging Students, Volume 6
---

It is my pleasure to announce the call for submissions for the upcoming volume of Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy. We would like to have short essays (approx. 1500 words) on the subject of student-centered learning. Submissions are due June 1, 2018, and we hope to publish the complete volume online in August to assist readers in their planning for fall courses. Engaging Students serves as an open-access, web-based resource for those teaching college-level classes in music.

We are looking to combine essays of both a philosophical and practical nature on a wide range of topics relevant to the teaching of music at the university level. These include (but are not limited to) assessment, learning outcomes, in-class and out-of-class activities, and technology. We are also interested in a balance between essays dealing with more general topics (for example, strategies for dealing with different learning styles in a variety of contexts) and those dealing with more specific topics (for example, a particular activity that has proven useful in mastering a particular skill). See previous volumes of [*Engaging Students*](http://www.flipcamp.org/engagingstudents/) for examples.
 
Essays should be loosely modeled on what Dan Cohen, Executive Director of the Digital Public Library of America, calls the “blessay” (blog-essay). More information about the blessay format can be found in our [*style guide*](http://www.flipcamp.org/esstyle/).

Since its inception, Engaging Students has utilized peer-review and we are proud of our collaborative revision model where our reviewers work with authors to improve their work. While we will keep this excellent model in place, I am excited to announce that starting with volume 6, we will be moving to a new blind-acceptance process. 

Once an article is provisionally accepted through blind review, it will move on to the open collaborative review process. The e-journal will then be published with a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license (CC BY–SA) that will protect authors’ rights while allowing for free and open online access. More information about creative commons licenses can be found [here](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/).  

You will receive acknowledgment of your manuscript within one week after the submission deadline. Provisional acceptances will be sent around July 1st, and you should plan to be electronically available during July to accomplish the majority of the peer editing process. As in previous volumes, the revision process will consist of efficient online interactions between you and the editorial group.

Detailed submission instructions (as well as additional information about licensing, the review process, our editorial team, and the project in general) can be found on the [submission page.](/essubmit/)
 
Thank you,
The Editorial board of Engaging Students
