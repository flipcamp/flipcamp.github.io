title: Call for Participation&#58; Engaging Students, Volume 7
---

It is our pleasure to announce the call for submissions for the upcoming volume of <i>Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy</i>. This will be a special issue on the topic of curriculum reform. We would like to have short essays (approx. 1500 words) on this topic and hope to also set up some collaborative spaces for contributors to discuss different models. <b>Submissions are due May 31, 2019</b>, and we hope to publish the complete volume online by the Fall. Engaging Students serves as an open-access, web-based resource for those teaching college-level classes in music.

The focus of this volume will be curriculum reform and we would like to hear about how you are altering your theory curriculum to meet the needs of your students. We are hoping to gather a wide array of curricular models and compare the strengths and fit of each. 
 
 In terms of format, essays should be loosely modeled on what Dan Cohen, Executive Director of the Digital Public Library of America, calls the “blessay” (blog-essay). More information about the blessay format can be found on our [*style guide for authors*](http://www.flipcamp.org/esstyle/).

Building off of the success last year, Engaging Students will continue to have a blind-acceptance process that moves essays on to our peer-review stage where authors and peer-editors work together to improve essays and prepare them for publication.  

Once an article is provisionally accepted through blind review, it will move on to the open collaborative review process. The e-journal will then be published with a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license (CC BY–SA) that will protect authors’ rights while allowing for free and open online access. More information about creative commons licenses can be found [here](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/).  

You will receive acknowledgment of your manuscript within one week after the submission deadline. Provisional acceptances will be sent around July 1st, and you should plan to be electronically available during July to accomplish the majority of the peer editing process. As in previous volumes, the revision process will consist of efficient online interactions between you and the editorial group.

Detailed submission instructions (as well as additional information about licensing, the review process, our editorial team, and the project in general) can be found on the [submission page.](/essubmit/)
 
Thank you,
The Editorial board of <i>Engaging Students</i>
