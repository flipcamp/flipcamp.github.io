title: Engaging Students&#58; Submission Instructions and Review Process
---

## Process ## 

1. Compose an essay that conforms to the Engaging Students [Style Guide](/esstyle/), including the required copyright statement. Please note as well that we would like citations in the Author-Date format. Save the document as a pdf and submit it as an attachment to engagingstudentsmusic@gmail.com by **June 1, 2018** (Please be sure that you either create the document as google doc at this stage or that you can convert it to a google doc, as we will need your essay in that form if it is provisionally accepted). You will receive a confirmation email within a week of the submission deadline. 

2. Your article will then go through the blind-acceptance process and we are hoping to send results out by **July 1, 2018.**

3. If your article is provisionally accepted, we will need you to share the Google doc with the Engaging Students Google account (engagingstudentsmusic@gmail.com), granting Engaging Students permission to edit. We will then be able to assign reviewers to edit your essay. If you need assistance with the technology, please contact one of the co-editors (see below).

4. For this volume, the peer editing process will take place during July, and we hope that you get comments on your article by the first week. It is very important that you are electronically available to work on your essay during the month of July. Please keep an eye on your email or the document itself for comments from the reviewers, who will work with you to improve your essayâ€”in some cases to bring it up to standard and in line with the style of the volume, and in all cases in order to assist you in communicating your ideas as clearly as possible in order to have the greatest impact possible. When you receive a comment, please respond to the comment and/or revise the essay in light of your discussion with your reviewer(s). When you are satisfied that the issue raised by the reviewer has been resolved, mark the comment as resolved. (It will disappear, but will still be accessible in the document history if you want to revisit it later.) We hope to have all revisions complete by **July 27, 2018.**

## Acceptance and rejection ##

We will be using a new blind-acceptance process, where provisionally accepted essays will move on to the peer-editing stage that has been successful in past volumes. While we still envision the submission to publishing process will be smooth, the editorial board reserves the right to reject essays at the end of the revision process that are initially promising, but which do not reach the desired standard during the course of the peer-editing process.
Final acceptance/rejection notifications will come via email, hopefully around July 31st. Our goal is to publish the volume in mid-August.

If you have any questions about the process, the technology, or the license, please contact Philip Duker or Bryn Hughes.
