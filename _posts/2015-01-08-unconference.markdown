title: Engaging Students&#58; An Unconference on Music Pedagogy
description: |
  <p class="lead">Unfortunately the Engaging Students Unconference will be having a hiatus for the 2017 summer, we hope to host an unconference once again in 2018. In the mean time, if you want to go to a summer theory pedagogy conference, we recommend that you check out the [Pedagogy into Practice conference](https://music.appstate.edu/about/music-theory-pedagogy-online/conference/)</a></p>
