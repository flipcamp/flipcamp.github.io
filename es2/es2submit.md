## Process ## 

1. Compose an essay in a Google document (or compose it elsewhere and paste it into a Google document). Be sure the essay conforms to the Engaging Students [Style Guide for Authors]({{ root_url }}/es2/es2style.html), including the required copyright statement. Be sure to *create a new Google document*; please do not create a Word document or a PDF and upload it to Google Drive. If you need assistance with the technology, please contact one of the coordinating editors (see below).

2. Share the Google doc with the FlipCamp Google account (flipcampmt@gmail.com), granting FlipCamp permission to edit. (NB: Your essay will be reviewed non-anonymously.) You will receive a confirmation email within a couple days of submission, and possibly requests to share the document with others (your reviewers and the coordinating editors). Be sure to grant these permissions promptly. You will also receive a follow-up email within a week or two notifying you of your assigned reviewers, as well as any modifications to the review and publication schedule.

3. Keep an eye on your email or the document itself for comments from the reviewers, who will work with you to improve your essayâ€”in some cases to bring it up to standard and in line with the style of the volume, and in all cases in order to assist you in communicating your ideas as clearly as possible in order to have the greatest impact possible. When you receive a comment, please respond to the comment and/or revise the essay in light of your discussion with your reviewer(s). When you are satisfied that the issue raised by the reviewer has been resolved, mark the comment as resolved. (It will disappear, but will still be accessible in the document history if you want to revisit it later.) Make sure all revisions are complete **by July 25.**

## Acceptance and rejection ##

In the spirit of collaborative review, the editorial board will make rejection decisions as soon after submissions as possible, and before the review stage begins. However, the editorial board reserves the right to reject essays at the end of the process that are initially promising, but which do not reach the desired standard during the course of the review process.

Final acceptance/rejection notifications will come via email, hopefully within a week of the July 25 deadline. Our goal is to publish at least the first format of the ebook by August, with other freely accessible formats to follow as quickly as possible.

If you have any questions about the process, the technology, or the license, please contact [Kris Shaffer](mailto:kris.shaffer@gmail.com) or [Bryn Hughes](mailto:bryn.hughes@gmail.com).
