title: Call for Participation&#59; Engaging Students, Volume 2

# {{ page.title }} #

We are excited to solicit short essays (approx. 1500 words) on the subject of student-centered learning for the second volume of *Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy*. Submissions are due **July 10, 2014,** and we hope to publish the complete volume online by August, in time for these essays to assist readers in their planning for fall courses. *Engaging Students* serves as an open-access, web-based resource for those teaching college-level classes in music.

Our format for scholarly communication is based upon [collaborative and swift peer review]({{ root_url }}/es2/es2review.html). We take our inspiration from hack-a-thons, in which creative solutions to a problem emerge from working intensely together in a collaborative environment for a limited time, as well as the crowdsourced ebook, [*Hacking the Academy*](http://www.digitalculture.org/books/hacking-the-academy-new-approaches-to-scholarship-and-teaching-from-digital-humanities/), and the open-access journal, [*Hybrid Pedagogy*](http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/collaborative-peer-review-gathering-the-academys-orphans/). You will receive feedback on your manuscript within two weeks of the submission deadline. The revision process will consist of efficient online interactions between you and the editorial group.

We are looking to combine essays of both a philosophical and practical nature on a wide range of topics relevant to the teaching of music at the university level. See [*Engaging Students, Volume 1*](http://www.flipcamp.org/engagingstudents/), for examples.
