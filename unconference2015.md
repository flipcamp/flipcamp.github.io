# Opening session — Thursday, July 23, 11am EDT

The online unconference will begin at **11am EDT on Thursday July 23** with a "Google Hangouts On Air." This will be the meeting at which we get everyone oriented to how the unconference will unfold and the tech tools we'll be using to facilitate the online sessions. It will also be when we vote on the session proposals and plan out the detailed schedule of events for the online unconference.

The live video "broadcast" for this session will be embedded on this page, and a link will be provided for unconference participants to join the discussion via video chat or text chat. (Google Hangouts supports up to 10 video participants at a time, but everyone will be able to join the text chat and watch the video.)

We will also be collaborating on a Google Doc, as we plan the specifics of the unconference together. Please [load up that document](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/hoaevent/AP36tYcfPCHB_oidhIDaq58eQnA5WeYDMCL-bDx8CyzChlcPhaw8oA
) and follow along/contribute as we plan!

# Pre-conference to-do list

In order to hit the ground running on Thursday, please make sure you have the following tools installed and in working order before Thursday morning's session. If you have any difficulty getting going, please contact one of the [conference organizers](https://flipcampmt.wordpress.com/organizers/) or the [official Engaging Students email account](mailto:flipcampmt@gmail.com).

- [Twitter](http://twitter.com) — be sure to set up an account and follow [@FlipCampMT](http://twitter.com/flipcampmt) for announcements and links. The following videos may help you get started: [Introduction to Twitter](https://vimeo.com/133696253) & [Introduction to TweetDeck](https://vimeo.com/133696254).  
- [Google Drive](http://drive.google.com) — Many of our sessions will involve the creation and editing of collaborative documents in Google Drive. All you need is a Google account (if you have Gmail, or if your institution uses Google Apps for Education, you already have an account). If you will be working from a mobile device, such as an iOS or Android tablet, you may also want to install the Google Drive mobile app for your device. Finally, login to Google Drive, [open our shared resources folder](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B4yHG56u9Tu6fi1GSWhOMWNackwtRkkxRVNoaWpFR1FLbThJTElZUzZqX0V4LXZ1Vk9kTWs&usp=sharing), and click "Add to my drive" to have easy access to the resources we'll be working on. (Currently this folder is view only, for security purposes, but we will grant sharing privileges to all *registered* unconference attendees before the unconference begins.)  
- [Google Hangouts](https://www.google.com/tools/dlpage/hangoutplugin) — Once your Google account is up and running, download and install the Google Hangouts plugin (or the mobile app for your device) in the device/browser you plan on using for the unconference. 

Once you have everything setup — particularly your Google account and Hangouts plugin — see below for information about the opening session.
