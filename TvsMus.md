Will you remain loyal and #resist the temptations of other teams? Will you lead your team to victory? 

# Game play

To play the game, sign up for Twitter (if you don't already have an account). Then follow @FlipCampMT and post a tweet:

> Hey, @FlipCampMT, I'm ready to play #TvsMus!

Be sure to include the #TvsMus hashtag in all of your game-related tweets. It is not case-sensitive, but it must be spelled correctly, with no space between # and TvsMus. 

We will tweet out more instructions as the game progresses, beginning at 11am EDT. Keep checking back on this page, though, as we'll post big updates here throughout the game (team rosters, missions completed, etc.).

# Missions

## ULTIMATE MISSION

Are you a team player? Can you keep your team together? Can you beat the clock? The first team to complete all missions wins. BUT! World domination always sounded nice too. Who wants to be all heroic and complete quests anyway? Who are you, some kind of plucky warrior? No, you want it all. Recruit all #TvsMus players to your team and win. Cooperation or domination? You decide! *evil cackle*

## Mission 0

\#TvsMus #Mission0: In this strange new place, we like to pick favorites. Pick yours now, but choose wisely…and only one! *evil cackle*

\#TvsMus #Mission0 Part 2: Hatch that egg. No one trusts a faceless teammate. But are you really who you say you are???

## Mission 1

Look around. Who else shares your favorite musician? They are now your teammates. Bond. Shake hands. Tweet some stuff. But some among you may not share that special bond. That group over there has cookies. Switch teams if you want cookies. If your team needs more people, #recruit a specific user from another team. Is someone trying to steal your new best friend? #Protect them. Do you feel the pull of the 19th century? #Resist it to remain on your current team. Or betray them all. *evil cackle*

But there's a catch... During this mission, each person can only #recruit twice, #resist once, and #protect once. Use those actions wisely.

Teams: Schenker, Bowie


## Mission 2: Team proposal vote

I hear you have all gathered here for a noble cause. But there are so many proposals and so little time! Now that you have all met and shown your loyalties, peruse the ES conference OL proposals. Come to a group consensus on your favorite. Leave a reminder of your team’s legacy. Proclaim to the world your choice. And rejoice with cookies. *evil cackle* 

Visit ES page, discuss a favorite proposal for team, comment with team hashtag. Then tweet a link to the proposal you favorited.

## Mission 3: Google Doc

Leaving a comment on a blog isn’t enough for your team, is it? You want a whole document to yourselves! Fine, fine. Create your own document. Just like cookies, the best documents are made from scratch. Scrawl all over it. Play around with some edits. Show the world you make a mean, lean document. *evil cackle*

Create a public Google Doc. Everyone on the team open the doc and make a simple edit (like “[name] was here!”). Post a link to the GDoc on Twitter.

## Mission 4: GHO and Picture upload

Reading proposals? Making documents? How lame. This is the 21st century, after all. You can do better. Video conferencing is no longer a dream for the future! Start a Google Hangout and show the world the glory of your team. Post proof of your event in a picture and don’t forget the cookies! *evil cackle*
Start a Google Hangout, have everyone on the team join the chat, and take a screenshot of the hangout with all participants in view. Tweet the screenshot to complete the mission.

# Introduction to Twitter

This game is designed to help familiarize participants with the basic features of Twitter, Google Docs, and other tools that we'll be making use of during the unconference. However, if you'd like a little extra warmup to Twitter before the game starts, check out the following videos. It might give you a leg up on the competition.
