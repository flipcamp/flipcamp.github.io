Will you remain loyal and #resist the temptations of other teams? Will you lead your team to victory? 

# Game play

To play the game, sign up for Twitter (if you don't already have an account). Then follow @FlipCampMT and post a tweet:

> Hey, @FlipCampMT, I'm ready to play #TvsMus!

Be sure to include the #TvsMus hashtag in all of your game-related tweets. It is not case-sensitive, but it must be spelled correctly, with no space between # and TvsMus. 

We will tweet out more instructions as the game progresses, beginning at 11am EDT. Keep checking back on this page, though, as we'll post big updates here throughout the game (team rosters, missions completed, etc.).

# Introduction to Twitter

This game is designed to help familiarize participants with the basic features of Twitter, Google Docs, and other tools that we'll be making use of during the unconference. However, if you'd like a little extra warmup to Twitter before the game starts, check out the following videos. It might give you a leg up on the competition.
