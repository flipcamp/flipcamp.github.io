*Engaging Students* began with [FlipCamp Music Theory 2013](http://flipcampmt.wordpress.com), an unconference on the inverted music theory class, hosted by [Charleston Southern University](http://csuniv.edu). 2014 brought [FlipCamp Music Theory 2014]({{ root_url }}/2014/) at the University of Delaware.

A number of the attendees from FlipCamp Music Theory 2013 joined together to form the editorial board for a new project, a crowdsourced ebook on student-centered pedagogy in university-level music courses. The result of that project is *Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy*. There are two volumes published to date:

- [Volume 1 (2013)](engagingstudents/index.html)  
- [Volume 2 (2014)](engagingstudents2/index.html)  

We hope that the future will bring more unconferences, ebooks, and other events and resources. Keep an eye on this page or the [Engaging Students Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/flipcampmt) for new projects and announcements.
