# FlipCamp — an unconference on the inverted classroom #

FlipCamp Music Theory 2014 is coming! June 4–6 at the University of Delaware. More info [here](http://flipcampmt.wordpress.com).

FlipCamp began with [FlipCamp Music Theory 2013](http://flipcampmt.wordpress.com), an unconference on the inverted music theory class, hosted by [Charleston Southern University](http://csuniv.edu). A number of the attendees from FlipCamp Music Theory 2013 joined together to form the editorial board for a new project, a crowdsourced ebook on student-centered pedagogy in university-level music courses. The result of that project is [*Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy*](engagingstudents/index.html).

We hope that the future will bring more unconferences, ebooks, and other events and resources. Keep an eye on this page or the [FlipCamp Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/flipcampmt) for new projects and announcements.
