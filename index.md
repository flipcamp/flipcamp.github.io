# FlipCamp — an unconference on the inverted classroom #

The call for participation for *Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy*, Volume 2, is now open. Deadline is **July 20, 2014,** with an anticipated date of publication in early August 2014. Prospective authors, please see the [call for participation]({{ root_url }}/es2/es2cfp.html), the [style guide for submissions]({{ root_url }}/es2/es2style.html), and [submission instructions]({{ root_url }}/es2/es2submit.html). 

FlipCamp began with [FlipCamp Music Theory 2013](http://flipcampmt.wordpress.com), an unconference on the inverted music theory class, hosted by [Charleston Southern University](http://csuniv.edu). A number of the attendees from FlipCamp Music Theory 2013 joined together to form the editorial board for a new project, a crowdsourced ebook on student-centered pedagogy in university-level music courses. The result of that project is [*Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy*](engagingstudents/index.html). 2014 brought [FlipCamp Music Theory 2014]({{ root_url }}/2014/), June 4–6 at the University of Delaware.

We hope that the future will bring more unconferences, ebooks, and other events and resources. Keep an eye on this page or the [FlipCamp Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/flipcampmt) for new projects and announcements.
