<p>We are excited to solicit short essays (approx. 1500 words) on the subject of student-centered learning for the second volume of <em>Engaging Students: Essays in Music Pedagogy</em>. Submissions are due <strong>July 20, 2014,</strong> and we hope to publish the complete volume online by August, in time for these essays to assist readers in their planning for fall courses. <em>Engaging Students</em> serves as an open-access, web-based resource for those teaching college-level classes in music.</p>

<p>Our format for scholarly communication is based upon collaborative and swift peer review. We take our inspiration from hack-a-thons, in which creative solutions to a problem emerge from working intensely together in a collaborative environment for a limited time, as well as the crowdsourced ebook, <a href="http://www.digitalculture.org/books/hacking-the-academy-new-approaches-to-scholarship-and-teaching-from-digital-humanities/"><em>Hacking the Academy</em></a>, and the open-access journal, <a href="http://www.hybridpedagogy.com/journal/collaborative-peer-review-gathering-the-academys-orphans/"><em>Hybrid Pedagogy</em></a>. You will receive feedback on your manuscript within two weeks of the submission deadline. The revision process will consist of efficient online interactions between you and the editorial group.</p>

<p>We are looking to combine essays of both a philosophical and practical nature on a wide range of topics relevant to the teaching of music at the university level. These include (but are not limited to) assessment, learning outcomes, in-class <em>and</em> out-of-class activities, and technology. We are also interested in a balance between essays dealing with more general topics (for example, strategies for dealing with different learning styles in a variety of contexts) and those dealing with more specific topics (for example, guidelines for using a specific computer application that has proven especially useful in mastering a particular skill or concept). See <a href="http://www.flipcamp.org/engagingstudents/"><em>Engaging Students, Volume 1</em></a>, for examples.</p>

<p>In terms of format, essays for this book should be loosely modeled on what Dan Cohen, Executive Director of the Digital Public Library of America, calls the “blessay” (blog-essay). More information about the blessay format can be found on our <a href="/es2/es2style.html">style guide for authors</a>.​</p>

<p>Submissions will be selected and edited through a <a href="/es2/es2submit.html">collaborative review process</a>. The e-book will then be published with a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license (CC BY–SA) that will protect authors’ rights while allowing for free and open online access. More information about creative commons licenses can be found <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Those wishing to contribute to this publication should submit their essays by <strong>July 20, 2014.</strong> Detailed submission instructions (as well as additional information about licensing, the review process, our editorial team, and the project in general) can be found on <a href="/es2/es2submit.html">the submission page</a>.</p>
